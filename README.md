# Predicting Factors that affect HDB Resale Prices

Description
--- 
This repo details the ipynb used to run the models + extract external data used in the modelling.

Items inside this Repo
---
There are two main ipynb files in this repo, and a folder containing all the data assets:

1. `resale_prediction.ipynb` is the main notebook which details the code needed to generate the models and validation metrics
2. `get_coordinates.ipynb` is the notebook that is used to extract the external data needed to build the models (e.g. calling OneMap APIs to get coordinates, and calculate distance between flat and amenitites)
3. All raw data is stored in the /data folder
