# Predicting Factors that affect HDB Resale Prices

Model prediction for Singapore HDB resale prices

There are two main ipynb files in this repo:

1. resale_prediction.ipynb is the main notebook which details the code needed to generate the models and validation metrics
2. get_coordinates.ipynb is the notebook that is used to extract the external data needed to build the models (e.g. calling OneMap APIs to get coordinates, and calculate distance between flat and amenitites)

All raw data is stored in the data folder
